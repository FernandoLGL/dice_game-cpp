# Dice Game in C++

* There is a single die, players throw it in turns and accumulate points;
* The player may throw the cube several times in his turn; 
* If a *1* is thrown, his turn is over and the points accumulated in that turn are lost;
* The player may stop voluntarily (then the points accumulated are added to his total);
* Once the player's turn is over, the die is transferred to another player - who plays in the same manner;
* First to get to 100 points total, wins.
